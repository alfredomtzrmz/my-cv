      My journey as a FrontEnd Engineer has been marked by multiple successful
      transitions of products from the ground up. By leading teams effectively,
      I ensure a workspace where teams can flourish, adding to our collective
      ability to craft stunning products. Currently, I work mostly with
      TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vue, Nuxt, Node.js, and Laravel. For over 7
      years, I have been immersed in remote collaborations with companies around
      the world.
